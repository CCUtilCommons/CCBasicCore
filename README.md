# üöÄ CCBasicCore

**CCBasicCore** is the core library of **CCUtilsCommons**, designed to provide **lightweight data structures** and **basic algorithms** in pure C ‚Äî portable across any platform.  
Think of it as a **minimalist STL for C**.

## üì¶ Features

### ‚úÖ CCVector

A simple yet efficient dynamic array (vector) implemented in C.
Supports common operations such as push, pop, get, set, resize, and clear.

Features:

- Dynamically resizable array for efficient memory usage.
- Type-agnostic, works with any data type.
- Easy element access with get and set.
- Optional deep-copy / custom free support through CCSpecialDefinedPack.

### ‚úÖ CCList
A robust circular doubly-linked list implemented in C.
Supports common operations such as push front/back, pop front/back, insert, erase, iterate, and size/empty checks.

Features:
- Circular doubly-linked structure ensures efficient traversal in both directions.
- Custom element handling via CCSpecialDefinedPack for deep copy, free, and compare functions.
- Safe edge handling for empty and single-node lists.
- High-performance under stress testing with millions of elements.
- Flexible iteration through CCBasicCore_CCListRunIterate.

### ‚úÖ CCStack (Abstract Stack Interface)

An object-oriented-style abstract stack interface implemented in C (a ‚Äúbase class‚Äù + vtable). Lets you switch implementations at runtime between CCVectorStack and CCListStack while exposing a single, stable API (push/pop/top/empty/size/destroy).

Features

- Abstraction & polymorphism: Vtable-based design hides implementation details behind a single CCStack type ‚Äî callers use the same functions regardless of backing implementation.

- Fixed element size per instance: Each stack is created with a fixed elem_size; a stack instance holds exactly one element type.

- Pluggable element handling: Optional callbacks (like a CCSpecialDefinedPack) support deep-copy, free, and compare semantics for complex element types.

Performance semantics:

- CCVectorStack ‚Äî contiguous storage, amortized O(1) push, O(1) pop/top, good cache locality.

- CCListStack ‚Äî doubly-linked list, O(1) push/pop/top, avoids reallocation overhead.

- Robust edge handling: Well-defined behavior for empty and single-element stacks (typically pop/top ‚Üí NULL).

- Testability & stress-ready: Designed for easy unit tests and stress tests (millions of ops) to validate correctness and memory behavior.

- Thread-safety optional: Implementations are not thread-safe by default; add external locking or instrument the implementations if concurrent access is required.

### ‚úÖ CCQueue

A flexible and efficient queue abstraction implemented in C.
Supports multiple backends (CCVectorQueue, CCListQueue) with a unified interface.

Features:

- Unified interface: Switch seamlessly between vector-based and list-based implementations.

- Core operations: push (enqueue), pop (dequeue), front, size, and empty checks.

- Safe edge handling: Returns NULL when popping from an empty queue.

- High-performance under stress: Validated with hundreds of thousands of elements.

- Extensible design: New queue implementations can be plugged in without changing client code.

### ‚úÖ CCDeque

A flexible double-ended queue (deque) implementation in C.
Supports efficient insertion and removal at both ends, with multiple backends (vector-based and list-based).

‚ú® Features

- Unified interface: Operations are accessed via CCDeque_Interface_t, allowing different internal implementations.

- Double-ended operations:
push_front, pop_front
push_back, pop_back
Front/Back accessors: Retrieve elements at either end in O(1).

- Multiple backends:

Vector-based deque (CCVectorDeque) ‚Äî contiguous memory, fast random access.

List-based deque (CCListDeque) ‚Äî doubly-linked structure, stable pointers.

- Custom element handling via CCSpecialDefinedPack:

- Deep copy (copier)

- Resource cleanup (freer)

- Comparison (compare)

- Safe edge handling: Robust behavior for empty or single-element deques.

- Cross-platform C API: Designed for embedded and desktop C projects.

## üîÆ Roadmap
* [‚àö] CCVector (C Dynamic Array)
* [‚àö] CCList (linked list)
* [ ] CCHashMap (hash table)
* [ ] CCString (string utility)
* [ ] More algorithms

---

## üí° Philosophy

* **Minimal**: Keep the API surface simple.
* **Portable**: Works on embedded, desktop, and server.
* **Performant**: Almost no overhead compared to raw arrays.
